I think I've got my sight for you
I don't mean to let it brew
I thought I thought it through
Now come on you know I just get confused
Come get your funky love story
I love it when the skies can't sleep
I left a message encased in me
So bye bye (so bye bye)
A flawless ending
So beautiful
You're so
You're so
Let's take a trip down a dark place baby
Look for me now I'm not that (crazy)
Let's talk about what makes you happy
Because I know (I know)
I'm calling for you
Come get your funky love story
I love it when the skies can't sleep
I left a message encased in me
So bye bye (so bye bye)
A flawless ending
So beautiful
My love is turning kinda grey
(I love it when you sing)
My heart is looking the other way
My love is turning kinda grey
(she loves it when you sing)
My heart is looking the other way
Come get your funky love story
I love it when the skies can't sleep
I left a message encased in me
So bye bye (so bye bye)
A flawless ending
Come get your funky love story
I love it when the skies can't sleep
I left a message encased in me
So bye bye (so bye bye)
A flawless ending
So beautiful
